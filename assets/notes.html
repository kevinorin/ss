The layout is split into two sections structurally:

1.) Elements inside the CSS selector "#Stage .layoutColumn" are styled as modules. 
---- Positioning within columns is purely based on standard flow, i.e. defaults to 'position: static'
---- Coordinates 'reset' inside each .layoutColumn container
---- Most components will fill the width of the column they are within. 
---- This section does not need styling. Styles are per-component, responsive columns handled by Bootstrap.

2.) Elements outside the CSS selector "#Stage .layoutRow" 
---- Navigation header
---- General color scheme
---- Typography and footer. 
---- Minor adjustments may also be needed for column sizing, margins and borders.

Similarly, the administrative dashboard uses a Bootstrap 2-col + 10-col layout as the base with the side navigation being 2-columns wide.
---- All styling to be done is within #AdminContent with the exception of "New" buttons
---- Change icon-buttons to appropriate FontAwesome icon or text
---- Setting font-size, font-color and link colors is needed
---- Forms need to be styled as mockup. Essentially means styling the global "input" element, along with textarea, as all forms share a consistent look
---- Table columns need sizing. Most reliable selector for active admin tables is 
---- ---- table columns : " #AdminContent table tbody tr"
---- ---- table cells : " #AdminContent table tbody tr td"
